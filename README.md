#### Live Fleet Tracking
The system continuously updates vehicle positions in real time as they move.  
Each movement event is stored locally in a database to preserve historical route data.  
The database is mounted on an external storage volume to ensure persistence and data durability.

## Deplyment of fleetman to aws using EKS to create the cluster:
